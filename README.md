Generate on demand critical css for component actions with minimum effort. It is pretty similar to: https://github.com/mudbugmedia/critical-path-css-rails but instead of pregenerating critical css this gem generates them in fly and dynamically.

## Installation

```bash
gem 'rails_critical_css'
```

## Usage

Install `penthouse` NPM package in your project. Be sure that node_modules/ directory is present on production builds.

In initializer:

```ruby
RailsCriticalCss.config do |c|
  c.keep_larger_media_queries = true
  c.height = 19999 # prevent CLS on for example footer
end
```

In controller:

```ruby
  class ExampleController < ApplicationController
    action_critical_css :show, cache_key: :critical_css_cache_key
    # or
    action_critical_css :show, cache_key: -> { 'cache_key' }
    # or
    action_critical_css :show, cache_key: 'cache_key'

    ...

    def critical_css_cache_key
      "some-dynamic-key-#{random_variable}"
    end
  end
```

In template:

```slim
  = critical_css_asset file: 'some-file-to-be-prepended-to-criticals', critical: true
  = critical_css_tags
    link rel="stylesheet" href="css/vendors.css" rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'
    link rel="stylesheet" href="css/app.css" rel='stylesheet' type='text/css'
```

## Testing

Enable redis caching on localhost and precompile locally assets. Critical CSS are generated using background job so they are injected to HTML after next requests (it takes around 3s)
